App Idea 1: UtilityMan
What: UtilityMan is an app for simple home repairs. It connects customers who need simple home repairs such as plumbing, painting, and lawn maintenance to people who can do the job.
Who: The app is targeted for everyday people who donâ€™t want to deal with a large company for a simple home repair and would prefer an easier solution.
Why: We are building this app as an alternative to the conventional way things have been done. A request can be made, and within 15 minutes a person suitable of completing a cheap, simple job can at your house ready to complete the request,
Challenges: Potential challenges include creating a wallet and payment system, along with geographically showing where the customer and the worker are on a map in real time. 


App Idea 2: StoreStock
What: StoreStock is an app that lets people find what's available in stores. The store type isn't specific. It can be food, clothes, or anything else. Optional: They can also reserve items
Who: The app is targetted at normal people who need to get shopping done. They can check if what they desire to buy is out of stock or not so they don't need to go in person and be disappointed.
Why: There are many ways that stores store their stock online, whether its their website, or ubereats or other apps, but most of the time the amount of the apps is limited or the store isnt very well updates. This app tries to get the stores stock all in one place for easier customer viewing.
Challenges: Challenges include getting stores to agree to add stock, as well as including a location bar that automatically looks for all the closest stores on the app. Another challenge could be a search bar that looks for the food.

App Idea 3: MusicMan 

What: Musicman is an application that allows users to track the albums/music they've listened, also allowing for reviews. Give users streaks + badges (EX: "Has heard 5 new albums today!; "has listened to a new album a day for 20 days" ... etc) to be able to share with users on the app. On top of this give users recommendations on similar genres, eras, and styles. 

Who: Geared towards avid music listeners who perhaps want to expand their repertoire and connect with others who enjoy listening to music (hobbyist, audiophiles, musicians).

Why: Spotify does have a great algorithm to give music reccomendations but this helps create a niche community of people who want to share, review and track the music they listen to on their journey. I believe there are people who still crave the nostalgic forum style community, as seen in apps like Reddit and Discord servers. 

Challenges: Finding algorithms that will generate music suggestions, being able to handle user account data and store them uniquely to individuals, and creating a nice "clean" interface to give users the best experience. 



App Idea 4: TaskTracker

What: TaskTracker is a task management app designed to help individuals and teams organize and prioritize their tasks and projects. It provides features such as task creation, due date tracking, progress monitoring, and collaboration tools.

Who: TaskTracker is suitable for anyone who needs to manage their tasks, from busy professionals and students to project managers and small businesses looking for a streamlined way to keep track of their work.

Why: In today's fast-paced world, people often struggle to stay organized and manage their tasks effectively. TaskTracker aims to simplify task management by offering a user-friendly and intuitive platform that enhances productivity and reduces the stress of keeping track of multiple responsibilities.

Challenges: Challenges include developing a user-friendly interface, implementing collaborative features like task sharing and real-time updates, and ensuring data security and privacy for users' task lists. Additionally, integrating the app across various devices and platforms could be a technical challenge.
